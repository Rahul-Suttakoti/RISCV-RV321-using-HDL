# RISCV-RV321-using-HDL

RISCV is assembly level language which deals with 0's and 1's.
RV321 is the version of RISCV language which usually loads data and stores data and even does arithmatic operations.
I've tried to implement the RISCV working using ALU,control units,hazard units,register files and few more using HDL coding.
